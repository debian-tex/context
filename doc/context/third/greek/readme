This is version 0.99 of the ConTeXt Greek module for typesetting ancient
(polytonic) Greek in ConTeXt. Copyright (C) 2006,2007, 2008 Thomas
A. Schmitz.



INSTALLATION

For instructions, see the file greekmodule.pdf. Here is a short version for the
impatient:

- Unzip the file texmf.zip in your local or personal texmf-tree.

- ConTeXt can load mapfiles on demand, and the module is set up to use this
  feature. If you have trouble with fonts not being found, try to update
  your mapfile by running updmap-sys --enable Map tasgreek.map

Unicode input will only work with ConTeXt versions later than
2005-03-16.
