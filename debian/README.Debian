README for using ConTeXt on Debian
==================================

All the documentation to ConTeXt will be provided in a separate package
	context-doc-nonfree
as we cannot include the sources.

If you want to activate more/different formats, please edit
	/etc/texmf/fmt.d/10context.cnf
call
	update-fmtutil
and
	fmtutil-sys
(all as root). For more details please see the Documentation TeX-on-Debian
in the tex-common package.
