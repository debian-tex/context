README for using ConTeXt on Debian
==================================

All the documentation to ConTeXt will be provided in a separate package
	context-doc-nonfree
as we cannot include the sources.

ConTeXt based formats are *NOT* defined in the usual way in 
/etc/texmf/fmtutil.d, instead please edit the file
	/etc/texmf/context/formats.cnf
which also contains explanations about available formats.

After editing this file please call as root
	ctxfmtutil --build
