* work around the problem that a dynamically generated context format 
  based on xetex does not work:
  	texexec --xtx foo.tex
		-> calls mktexfmt cont-en
			-> calls pdftex engine
				-> breaks
  mktexfmt is unfortunately buggy.
  Options:
  - document the behaviour in README.Debian
  - pre-generate xetex based format? But xetex is not necessarily installed!

* check/test/play around with the MkIV luatex stuff that should us get rid 
  of the tedious cache update problems.
