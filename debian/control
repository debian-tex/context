Description: powerful TeX format.
 ConTeXt is a typographical engine written in the typographical computer 
 language TeX. ConTeXt provides you with a convenient way to encode documents 
 in a structured way and to typeset these documents in various ways on paper, 
 computer screen or web site.
 .
 This package also contains MetaFun. MetaFun (a superset of well known 
 MetaPost) is a powerful system for vector graphics that is fully integrated
 into ConTeXt, but also usable as a stand alone product. 
 .
 MetaFun is not for interactive drawing applications and not for free hand 
 drawings. Its strength lies in the ability to enhance the document layout
 with highly accurate graphic elements.
