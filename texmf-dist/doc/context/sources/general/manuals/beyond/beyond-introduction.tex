This is the eights wrapup of the \LUATEX\ and \LUAMETATEX\ development cycle. The
last one was ontarget and focussed on what we did when the engine got mature.
This time we zoom in on developments that go a bit beyond what we originally
planned. One can argue that for instance some of the math extensions should have
ended up here but for us a turning point was when additional par passes became
stable, which was around the time of the 2024 \CONTEXT\ meeting. We'll see what
comes after that.
